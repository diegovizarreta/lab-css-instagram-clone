          <h2>Capture and Share <br>the World's Moments</h2>


          <p>Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with friends and family.
          
          Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; 
          it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.
          
          Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
